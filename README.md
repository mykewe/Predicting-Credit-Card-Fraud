# Predicting-Credit-Card-Fraud


* This project predicts which credit card transactions in the dataset are fraudulent using three classification algorithms and three synthetic balancing techniques. The three classifier algorithms we will train include:
  + Decision Tree, which uses a tree-like model of decisions to arrive at a classification prediction.
  + Naive Bayes, which uses Bayes' theorem to use probability to arrive at a classification prediction.
  + Linear Discriminant Analysis, which finds a linear combination of features that is then used to separate the classes and arrive at a classification prediction.
